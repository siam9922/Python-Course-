# Mini Store Price List
#Idea:
#Create a small "store" that has 3 items.
#Each item has:

#a name

#a price

#You will use variables for each item and its price.
#Then you print out a simple "menu" showing the items and their prices.


introduction = "Welcome to the Mini Store!"
print(introduction)

price_list_description = "Here is what we have today:\n"
print(price_list_description)

Apple = 1.50
Bread = 2.00
Milk = 3.25

print(f"1. Apple - ${Apple}")
print(f"2. Bread - ${Bread}")
print(f"3. Milk - ${Milk}\n")

display_thanks= "Thank you for visiting!"
print(display_thanks)
