ðŸ”§ Your Task:
Ask for the userâ€™s name (just for personalization).

Tell the user: "A masked robber approaches you and yells: 'Give me your money!'"

Show them 3 choices:

1: Give the money

2: Refuse to give the money

3: Try to run

Based on their input:

If they pick 1, print a scared response + amount given (ask for how much).

If they pick 2, print what happens when they refuse (maybe the robber gets angry).

If they pick 3, print a random outcome like "you escape" or "you trip and fall" (optional: use random module later).
