ðŸ“‹ Requirements:
Ask the user for their name.

Ask for weight and unit (Kg or Lb).

Convert weight to kg if it's in pounds.

Ask for height in meters.

Calculate BMI using the formula:
BMI = weight / (height ** 2)

Use if statements to show:

Underweight (BMI < 18.5)

Normal (18.5 â‰¤ BMI < 25)

Overweight (BMI â‰¥ 25)

Show a final summary using print() and round().
