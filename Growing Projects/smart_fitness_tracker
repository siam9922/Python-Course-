Project Title: Smart Fitness Tracker (Mini Version)
📋 Requirements:
Ask the user for their name.

Ask for weight and unit (Kg or Lb).

Convert weight to kg if it's in pounds.

Ask for height in meters.

Calculate BMI using the formula:
BMI = weight / (height ** 2)

Use if statements to show:

Underweight (BMI < 18.5)

Normal (18.5 ≤ BMI < 25)

Overweight (BMI ≥ 25)

Show a final summary using print() and round().

✅ 1. Use or for flexible input
Let your user type "k", "K", "l", or "L" — and your code should accept either version.

✅ 2. Use and for health warnings
After you calculate BMI, check if the person is overweight and has a low height. If both are true, give them an extra warning message.

✅ 3. Use not to warn when BMI is not normal
If the person’s BMI is not in the normal range, show a message saying:

“You are not in a healthy range.”

You can use not to flip the normal condition.
